      ADHD is one of the more common diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders formed from childhood.
      While it is seen more commonly with children, this disorder usually follows them to adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble with controlling impulsive behaviours, focusing on a certain task, or be hyper and overly active.
