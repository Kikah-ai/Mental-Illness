      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a common disorder where the person suffering from it performs a series of recurring events or
      rituals to help ease the anxiety that comes with the disorder. The disorder ranges in severity where a mild case would be a person who gets very anxious about something specific. An example of a severe case would be panic or anxiety attacks. People with a severe case of OCD are more likely to commit suicide then others that do not have it or have mild cases.
